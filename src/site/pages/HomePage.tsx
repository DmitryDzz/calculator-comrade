                        its Binary-Coded Decimal calculation algorithms.

                    An old pocket calculator can be surprisingly handy in everyday life.
                    For example, press <code>1 + =</code> and then keep pressing <code>=</code>
                    to use it as a counter. Or press <code>× =</code> to get a square number.
                    Or press <code>÷ =</code> to get <span className="home-page__calculator-variable"><var><sup>1</sup>/<sub>x</sub></var></span>&nbsp;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These small <a href={routes.tips}>tricks</a> are part of the charm of classic basic calculators.
                    Calculator Comrade keeps that behavior instead of turning the app into
                    another scientific calculator.

                        There are already thousands of calculators in the world,
                        and I probably cannot rule the world by selling one more.

                        It is a hobby project. Building it, studying old calculator behavior,
                        and recreating it accurately is part of the fun.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is also a small tribute to the pioneers who designed those early calculator processors.
                        The deeper I went into reverse engineering, the more I appreciated how thoughtful their
                        technical and user-experience decisions were.
